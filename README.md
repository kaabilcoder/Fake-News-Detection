# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that detects whether a given news headline or article is **fake or real** using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.  
It combines **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms** to help analyze the authenticity of news content in real time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In today’s digital world, the spread of fake news has become a major concern.  
This project aims to address this issue by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify news as *“Real”* or *“Fake”*.  

The model is trained using a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles.  
It processes raw text, extracts features using the **TF-IDF Vectorizer**, and classifies it using algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This model is trained on a static dataset and may not accurately classify newly emerging or real-time news articles.  
Predictions are based on learned patterns and should be treated as indicative, not absolute.  
For accurate verification, always refer to trusted fact-checking or official news sources.
